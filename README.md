# MuscleAssembly
A project for my Database Management Systems course in university. This was a group project where we had to create a database to handle a gym's data
## What is MuscleAssembly?
MuscleAssembly is a fictional fitness center chain / megabrand created by my group to the center focus of our DBMS project. The theme of this gym was the product of our "realistic" peek into what a gym of that caliber could look like in the future, and what type of information could be important to such an institution!
## What technologies where used to make this?
The actual database was made using Oracle's Express 11g software. For planning and visualization tools (like diagrams) we used the Microsoft office suite, namely Word for documentation and Visio for visual aids & diagrams.
## What did we learn?
In general we just had a deep look into what a database system looks like and the details of how it works!
We learned to go through almost everything from meeting with clients to discuss the requirements and expectations, to the database design, to implementation and documentation!
## Where can I see more details?
You can check the Microsoft Word file included in this repo for the details of how everything works and what sort of strategies we used to come up with what we have!
